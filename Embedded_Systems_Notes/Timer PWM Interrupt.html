<h2>TIMER PWM INTERRUPT</h2> 
<p>
    Is it possible to mix modes within one timer but on different channels(For example;  TIM1_CH1 – PWM, TIM1_CH2 – PWM, TIM1_CH3 - CNT) ? 
    <br>
    Yes, but they will share the <strong>counter</strong> and <strong>reload register</strong>. (<strong>Reload Register:  ARR</strong>)
    Each timer has only one counter, which is shared by its 4 channels. It can either count some clock events (<strong>APB</strong> clock, which usually equals the system clock), or one external trigger input. To generate a PWM signal, the counter must supply the <strong>PWM frequency</strong>.
